## Words Front End
This is the Next.js application for my Word personal project. I created this to help improve my vocabulary and web application skills.


## Before
One thing I wanted to do was refresh the UI. So here is the old one for comparison. 
</br>
<img src="images/Landing%20Page.png" width=800 height=400px/>
<img src="images/App%20Page.png" width=800 height=400px/>

## Today
<img src="images/Landing Page After.png" width=800 height=400px/>
<img src="images/App Page After.png" width=800/ height=400px>

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
